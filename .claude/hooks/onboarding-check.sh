APEXSTACK ONBOARDING NOT RUN

This repository has no .claude/session/onboarded marker. ApexStack needs a
short discovery pass before the first session so hooks, reviewers, and gates
know:

  - What project this is and where its code + tickets live
  - Which CI checks must run before push (lint, typecheck, test, build,
    framework-specific validators like `sam validate --lint` or `terraform validate`)
  - Who the reviewers are (Rex + human approver — Tech Lead, CEO, owner)
  - Whether this repo has UI work (design-review gate)
  - Deploy targets (staging, prod, where URLs live, auto-on-merge or manual)
  - Sensitive topics (anything that must never land in git or public issues)

Before starting any work in this repo, ask the user to run:

  /onboard

The skill will ask the questions and write both .claude/session/onboarded and
.claude/project-config.json. If the user wants to skip onboarding for a quick
one-off, they can: touch .claude/session/onboarded
